Learning React Course Notes
===========================

## Overview

This repository is where I will be working out of to learn the popular [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) JavaScript framework and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/). This course is being taught by Stephen Grider and can be found on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4). This ReadMe will be where I keep notes on what I am being taught.

Plan of Course:
- Get Boilerplate Project
- Gain Familiarity of React
- Learn General Data Modeling
- Dive into Redux

## Notes

- Our project files need tooling to transpile our code, we use Webpack and Babel to do this.
- NPM (node package manager), used to load in some dependancies.
